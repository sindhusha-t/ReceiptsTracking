## Use Case:
Every time when we purchase any items, we get a receipt. If merchant does not have email facility, we just take the printed receipt.Now such receipts are just stacked in our homes, waiting to be trashed.This app can help us analyze our purchases smartly.   
Develop mobile app to analyze purchases after scanning a receipt.
1. App should be able to scan receipts.
2. Scanned receipts data should be shown on App in nice format.
3. Such receipts data can be grouped by various categories such as good, clothes, etc.
4. All the steps should be automated with minimal manual intervention.
5. Extra points for adding any deep learning aspect in terms of analysis of receipts data.
